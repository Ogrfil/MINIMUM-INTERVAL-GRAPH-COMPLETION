## Minimum Interval Graph Completion

This project focuses on the **Minimum Interval Graph Completion** problem and was developed as part of the **Computational Intelligence** course in the fourth year of university studies. The project includes the implementation and comparison of several algorithms to solve the problem, including:

- Brute Force Algorithm
- Simulated Annealing
- Simulated Annealing with Cooling Schedules
- Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS)
- Genetic Algorithms
